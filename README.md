Goal:

Requirements:

Scrape or use API requests to gather players, height class, seasons averages(points, assists, etc) of opposing teams.

Have separate slots for in-conference and non-conference field goals, 3-pointers, free throws, total makes, and total attempts.  All should be per player and have percentages of each shooting stat.

Display data on a user-friendly front-end interface. Could be react, HTML, or a simple GUI such as STREAMLIT.
